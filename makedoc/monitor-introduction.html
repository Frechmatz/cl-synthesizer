<p>Monitors are hooks that are registered at racks. They collect module states like output socket values and pass them to a so
  called "Monitor Backend". A monitor backend can for example be a CSV-File-Writer.
A monitor backend is a module. It is instantiated by a so called "Monitor Agent".
This agent sits between the monitor and its backend. The agent instantiates the backend
  and defines the mapping of the values collected by the monitor to input sockets of the backend.</p>
