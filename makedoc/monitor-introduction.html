<p>Monitors collect module states, like input and output values, and pass them to a so
  called "Monitor Backend". A monitor backend can for example be a CSV-File-Writer
  or a Wave-File-Generator.
A monitor backend is a module with input sockets and an optional shutdown function. It is instantiated by a so called "Monitor Agent".
The agent sits between the monitor and its backend. The agent instantiates the backend
  and defines the mapping of the values collected by the monitor to input sockets of the backend.
Monitors register themselves as rack hooks.</p>
