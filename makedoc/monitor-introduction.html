<p>Monitors are hook functions that can be registered at racks. They collect module states, like output socket values, and pass them to a so
  called "Monitor Backend". A monitor backend can for example be a CSV-File-Writer.
A monitor backend implements the module interface. It is instantiated by a so called "Monitor Agent".
This agent sits between the monitor and its backend. The agent instantiates the backend
  and defines the mapping of the values collected by the monitor to input sockets of the backend.</p>
