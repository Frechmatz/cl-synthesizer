<p>Monitors are high-level Rack-Hooks. The purpose of a monitor
is to collect module states and pass them to a "Monitor-Backend". A backend may
for example generate a Wave file.</p> 
<p>Monitors provide a simple syntax for declaring the module sockets to be tracked (input, output and state) as well as any other settings supported by specific backends.</p>
<p>A backend is typically realized as a plain module, which declares
input sockets, output sockets, a shutdown function and so on. Backends are 
instantiated by a so called "Monitor-Agent".</p>
<p>A Monitor-Agent is a factory function whose purpose is to prepare the initialization 
parameters of a specific backend (e.g. a Wave-File-Writer module), to set up the 
mapping of the values collected by the monitor to input sockets of the backend 
and finally to instantiate it.</p>
