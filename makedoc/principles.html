cl-synthesizer has been developed with the following principles in mind:
<ul>
    <li>No dependencies to system libraries. The Common Lisp Standard Library shall it be.</li>
    <li>No use of classes in the public interface (not in the first place for technical reasons, but for a personal study of alternatives).</li>
</ul>
