cl-synthesizer has been developed with the following principles in mind:
<ul>
    <li>No dependencies to system libraries, such as Audio output or MIDI bindings.
	The Common Lisp Standard Library shall it be.</li>
    <li>Extensive unit testing. The library comes with hundreds of unit tests.</li>
    <li>Extensive profiling of consing and execution speed.</li>
</ul>
