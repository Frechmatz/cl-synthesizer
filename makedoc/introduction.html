<p>A Modular Audio Synthesizer Engine implemented in Common Lisp.
    <p>cl-synthesizer is an easy to use library which follows the approach of
      a classical hardware modular synthesizer, where modules are put into a rack and patched together with cables.</p>
</p>
<p>cl-synthesizer has been developed with the following principles in mind:
<ul>
    <li>No dependencies on binding libraries. The Common Lisp Standard Library shall it be.</li>
    <li>Extensive unit testing.</li>
    <li>Extensive profiling of consing and execution speed.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The source code of cl-synthesizer can be found <a href="https://github.com/Frechmatz/cl-synthesizer">here</a>.</p>
