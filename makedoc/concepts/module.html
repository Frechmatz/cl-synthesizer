<p>Modules are the heart of cl-synthesizer because they are responsible for producing the
actual audio data.</p>
<p>Modules do have a name, inputs and outputs. The inputs/outputs are represented by keywords
and are so called sockets.</p>
<p>Beside the input/output sockets a module can also declare "state sockets".
State sockets expose internal states of the module. These sockets 
are not accessible when connecting modules with each other. They are meant 
to be a debugging/analysis tool. For example to create a plot of the phase of an 
oscillator over time, a :phase state socket in conjunction with a Monitor is the way to go.</p>
<p>A module is represented by a property list. This list provides functions such as
to get the input sockets, to get the output sockets, to get the state sockets, 
to set input values, to retrieve output values, to update the module, to
shutdown the module and so on.</p>
<p>A module must provide a factory/instantiation function. The typical name of this 
    function is "make-module". When a module is added to the synthesizer then not the 
    readily instantiated module (as a property list) is passed, but its factory function. 
    This function is called by the synthesizer. The synthesizer passes the module name, 
    the environment and any arbitrary initialization parameters to it.</p>
<p>A module can implement all its logic on its own but it can also use
    other modules. An example of a module using other modules is the
    <a href="https://github.com/Frechmatz/cl-synthesizer/blob/master/src/modules/mixer.lisp">Mixer</a></p>
<p>For each input/output socket that a module exposes, it must provide a corresponding setter/getter function. When processing an update, the synthesizer sets the inputs of the module via successive calls to the input setters. An input setter must not change the current output state of the module. When all inputs have been set, the synthesizer calls the update function of the module, which has no arguments. The update function must update the states of the output sockets, by using the previously set input values.<br>This design decision has been made for the following reasons:
    <ul>
	<li>Assuming that the update function of a module is to be called with maybe keyword arguments, creating the arguments list is expensive. Additionally, any consing is a no-go.</li>
	<li>Assuming that the update function of a module is to be called with arguments, like keyword parameters, accessing them inside the update function is expensive.</li>
	<li>Assuming that a module provides a generic get-output function, that for example is to be called with a keyword, the module must implement an expensive lookup, where the argument is mapped to an output value.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
