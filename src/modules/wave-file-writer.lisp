  <ul>
    <li>name Name of the writer.</li>
    <li>environment The synthesizer environment.</li>
    <li>:channel-count Number of channels.</li>
    <li>:filename The relative path of the file to be written. The filename will be concatenated
        with the base path as defined by the :home-directory property of the environment.</li>
    <li>:v-peak Optional peak voltage. The inputs of the module will be scaled
	to v-peak. If for example v-peak is set to 20.0 an incoming voltage
	of 5.0 results in a sample value (which is written into the wave file)  
        of 5.0 / 20.0 -> 0.25 and an incoming voltage of -5.0 results in a sample 
        value of -0.25. The default value is 5.0. Incoming voltages will be clipped 
        according to v-peak.</li>
    <li>:sample-width Resolution of samples. One of :8Bit, :16Bit, :24Bit</li> 
  </ul>
  The module has the following inputs:
  <ul>
      <li>:channel-1 ... :channel-n The sample values of the generated frames
	  are written in order :channel-1 ... :channel-n</li>
  </ul>
  The module has no outputs.
